# Twitter Data Collection Project

## Overview

This project aims to collect tweets related to a specific brand or keyword using the Twitter API v2. The collected tweets are processed and exported to a CSV file for further analysis, such as visualizations in Power BI.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the collected tweet data.
- **Export to CSV**: Save the processed tweets to a CSV file for easy import into Power BI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `tweepy`: To interact with the Twitter API.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and export to CSV.
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tweepy pandas
